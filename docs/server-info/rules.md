# Server Rules

<div class="prestige-notes">
  <h3>⚠️ Important</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>These rules apply both in-game and in Discord.</li>
    <li>Server management may adjust rules or take action as necessary to maintain a fair and enjoyable environment, even if not explicitly stated.</li>
    <li>Rust is a multiplayer game. If you make a choice that directly leads to the loss of your items/progress, the admin team will not be stepping in. We will only step in to reset and refund items/RP/XP that is lost through no fault of your own (e.g., encountering a bug).</li>
  </ul>

## Chat Rules

### Hate Speech/Racism
Hate speech and racism will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to: overtly hateful speech, covertly hateful speech, racism baiting, chat filter work arounds, signs, fireworks, etc.

### Toxicity/Spamming/Excessive Trolling
Engaging in behavior that is intentionally toxic, annoying, and/or attention-seeking is not okay. You will be muted. Excessive and/or repeated offenses will result in a ban.

### Arguing in Chat
Rust is, by nature, a toxic game. However, if it is continuously filling up the chat, the mod team will take action as is appropriate for the situation.

### Arguing with Staff
We understand that things may happen that are frustrating; however, staff assistance is a privilege, not a right. Be respectful – our team works hard to support the community. Disrespect or arguing with staff may result in your ticket being closed without resolution, and can lead to a mute or further action.

### Impersonating a Staff Member
Impersonating a member of staff will result in disciplinary action based on severity, ranging from mutes to bans.

### Advertisement
Do not advertise other servers, products, or services.

### DMs and Staff Engagement
Do not DM staff. Create a ticket if you have a problem.

## Server Rules

### Cheating
Cheating is an immediate permanent ban.

### Association
Knowingly playing with a cheater will result in a minimum of a 30 day ban.

### Ban Evasion
You are unable to play on the server if you have a previous Server or Rust ban.

### Historical VAC/Game Bans
You are unable to play on the rust server if you have a VAC/Game ban less than 30 days old.

### Exploits
Finding a bug is not a free pass to exploit it. Report bugs by creating a ticket – abusing them for personal gain will lead to bans.

### Griefing
Griefing is the act of intentionally disrupting, blocking, or annoying other players – often for the sake of attention, revenge, or personal satisfaction. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Blocking bases or TC access
- Walling off monuments or essential areas
- Trapping players
- Stealing loot
- Using game mechanics to intentionally ruin another player's experience
