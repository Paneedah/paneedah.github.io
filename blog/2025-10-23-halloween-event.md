  <p>
    The time has come… Facepunch's annual Halloween update is here!  
    Our servers will be going offline shortly for a mandatory update and restart to bring in all the official Halloween goodness.

  <p>
    <strong>But that's not all—</strong><br/>
    When the lights come back on (or rather, when the fog rolls in 😈)… you'll find we've added our own horrifying twists to make this year's haunt extra deadly!
